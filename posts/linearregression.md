I won $100 on Monday, $200 on Tuesday, $300 on Wednesday, how much would I win on Thursday? If you answered $400 you just did linear regression!
The everyday predictions we make are mostly driven by linear regression. The number of miles you’ll run based on the time you run for and the energy level you have, the number of books you’ll read based on your new year resolution and last year’s number, the bonus you’ll get based on company performance and your own, house prices based on land size etc.
